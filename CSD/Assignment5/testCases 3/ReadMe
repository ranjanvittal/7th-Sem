we have enclosed 3 test cases.

1. "test1.xls" file contain assembly code without any stalls.
2. "test2.xls" file contains assembly code with RAW hazards.
3. "test3.xls" file contains assembly code control hazards.

Corresponding machine language programs are stored in respective ".b" files.

For LOAD/STORE instruction, out of 2 byte long instruction, first 4 bits are used for opcode, next 4 bits for destination/source register address and next 4 bits for source/destination. last 4 bits are ignored.

For JMP instruction we consider only first 8 bits. First 4 for opcode and next 4 bits for offset.

For above test cases we haven't considered BEQZ insturction.
