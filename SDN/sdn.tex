Coursera : Nick Feamster.\\
Network protocol layers :\\
Application layer, Transport layer : end to end and reliable,
Network layer : routing , congestion control, addressing and Quality of service
Link layer : link by link basis, Physical layer.\\

Components of a router :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Line cards.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item
Each line card is for one particular file layer technology.
Based in transmitter/Recv).
\item
Line cards these days have CPU and a memory dedicated to it.
\item
It also takes care of forwarding. A packet based on the input
header and route it to the next router on the route to the
destination router. From the input port which output port it goes out
in this router. Based on forwarding table it does all these.
A simple forwarding table will have an input port mapped to the output port
based on the header information. Address has two parts : network address
and host address. Number of possible networks is the bound for the number
of entries in the forwarding table.
\end{itemize}
\item Control Card : Also has CPU and memory. Handles all control packets.
Computes and loads the forwarding table.
\item Management Card : Also has CPU and memory. Handles all monitoring
packets.
\item Switch fabric connects the different cards.
\end{itemize}

There are some packets which could be control packet like non data
packet which is for routing protocols like OSPF. These are called control
packets. RIP, REP and ISIS are other routing protocols. An autonomous system
is the set of systems under one name (like reliance's systems under
reliance name). BGP is the border gateway protocol is like sendin packt
from one cluster to the next cluster. RIP is the protocol for internal
transfer.

We have various configurations possible which can be configured using SMP.\\
Some are simply forwarded like data packets. The other are used to make
some changes to the memory of the router.

Data plane or the forwarding plane, control plane and forwarding plane.\\
Routers do look at TCP header.\\

Innovations inside the network were growing at a slow rate.\\
Physical layers has been growing over the years. Wifi has
grown from 2 Mbps to about 1 Gbps. Cellular receives
about 5Mbps. Like from 2g to 3g to 4g the speeds increase.
The base state for optic networks was 155 Mbps. It has gone
upto 100 Gbps per channel. Hence it has gone to about 10 Tbps
on a link.\\

Application also has proceeded nicely. Changing things easily
is possible.\\
FIND : Future Intermediate Directions.\\
NGI : Next Generation of Internet.\\
Clean State Internet.\\
Goals :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Enable faster innovation in a production/live network.
People who want the above are vendors or manufactureres of network
equipment like cisco, juniper, tejas, huawei. The others who want
these are Internet Service Providers. They take the equipment
from the vendors and give internet service. The ISP has to give
some service agreement. If they want to add a new service they
have to go to the equipment vendor and ask for it. Based on something
already existing, if an innovation is happening, then it must be done quickly.
\item Network element programmability : An administrator should
be able to write high level programs to modify the network element
behaviour.
\item Given a large scale network, formally verifying connectivity between two
other nodes and such.\\
\item How to eliminate proliferation of middle boxes.\\
Middle box is a hardware sitting in the network between routers,
basically anywhere between soure and destination.\\
They enable :
\begin{itemize}
\item firewall.
\item proxies / caching.
\item NAT(Network Address Translation) / Gateway.
\item Load balancing.
\item Intrusion detection or prevention.
\item WAN optimizers/Application accelerators.
\item This might have the power to send acks, etc to the nodes in order
to change the parameters like recevier window size of the nodes.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The players involved are :\\
Internet service providers.\\
Enterprise nets are private networks like IIT, University of texas, etc.\\
Data center networks basically have racks of servers. They have almost
2 million IP addresses.\\
Content delivery network.\\
